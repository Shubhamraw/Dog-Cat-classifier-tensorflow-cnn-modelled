# Tutorial from Jason Brownlee. All thanks to him for making projects public. It helps a lot for beginner like us to know how things works 
# Dog and Cat image classification using CNN Tensorflow 2.3

My brief notes about the project 

ImageDataGenerator : Generate batches of tensor image data with real-time data augmentation
like a augmented reality, “Augmented reality (AR) is the real-time use of information in the form of text, 
graphics, audio, and other virtual enhancements integrated with real-world objects.” – Gartner's IT Glossary.
“Augmented reality is the rendering of digital images or data onto real-world objects.”


TensorFlow DeepCNNs to classify images of Dogs and Cats

• Keras ImageDataGenerator class is used to generate batches of tensor   
   imagedata with real-time data augmentation of dogs and cats images
   
• Developed a baseline CNN model and stacking more convolutional block  
   to improve performance further.  
   
• Regularization techniques are used to improve performance further and  
   to overcome the overfitting problem 
   
• Model achieved 82.63% of validation accuracy in the end
